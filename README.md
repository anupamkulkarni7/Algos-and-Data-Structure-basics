# Algorithms and Data Structures 

**This repo contains some codes for basic data structures like trees, graphs etc. along with solutions to multiple 
algorithms associated with them.**

## Data Structures
The **data_structures** folder has codes which define classes for the following:
1. Linked Lists
2. Stacks and Queues
3. Trees (Binary and BST)
4. Graphs
5. Tries

## Algorithms
The **algorithms** folder has solutions to many problems segregated according to the data structures used, or problem topic. 
You will find solutions to many problems from **Cracking the Coding Interview** along with other assorted interesting 
problems I came across.
